Please avoid sending me direct messages (DMs) to ask me questions. (Especially
technical questions.)

\
\

If you can ask me a question in a public space, please ask it there.\
If you can't or aren't sure whether you can ask it in public, feel free to DM
me (but know that my first response might be to request that you re-ask it in a
public space).

Some suggestions for public spaces to ask questions in include:

- the `#discuss` channel on the [Sorbet Slack] or the [Sorbet Twitter] account
  (for Sorbet-related questions),
- GitHub Issues and GitHub Discussions where available
- Public work channels (if you and I are co-workers)

The **exception**: if you have questions for me relating to my employer, or are
curious to know whether I'm open to new roles elsewhere, please **do** email or
DM me, as I do not prefer answering these questions in public.

Whatever you do, **do not** let the first message be merely "Hello" or "üëã"
because that will ding me immediately, and then I'll impatiently await the
actual question while watching a "user is typing" indicator.


## Why?

Questions are excellent moments to teach and share knowledge. When asked in
public spaces, a couple good things happen:

- Other people get to **see the question**.

  Sometimes other people learn more simply from seeing the questions other
  people are asking. Seeing other peoples' questions helps them expand their
  horizons into new territories.

- Other people get to **see the answer**.

  Chances are, you're neither the first nor the last person to ask me your
  question. By asking it in the open, it makes it easier for other people to
  find answers to their questions in the future.

- **My teammates** get a chance to learn from my answers.

  Part of my job is to help those around me grow. One way I can do this is by
  sharing my knowledge with them. When they get to see how I answer questions,
  it helps share my knowledge with my teammates and equip them to help answer
  similar questions in the future.

- You **get answers faster** in expectation.

  I check all notifications at the same speed. Whether you send me a DM or
  mention me in a Slack channel, I'll respond to those notifications at the same
  speed. For example, if I'm on vacation, I'll have *all* notifications paused,
  and you may not hear back from me for days or weeks. Asking the question in
  public increases your odds that someone else who can answer your question sees
  it quickly.

## Exceptions

Of course, feel free to send me DMs for situations like these:

- If you have something personal or confidential to say. This includes if you
  have individual feedback to give to me. (Thanks in advance for your feedback.)

- You're not comfortable asking a question in a public space. (If this is the
  case, please say so, otherwise my first response will likely be to request
  that you re-ask your question in public.)

- If you don't know of a good public space to ask it. For example, the [Sorbet
  Slack] is a good place to ask me Sorbet questions, but is not a good place to
  ask me questions about other projects. In these cases feel free to contact me
  directly (but know that if there is a good public forum to ask the question, I
  may redirect you there first before answering).

- To share jokes or memes üòâ (especially those that you think might be
  misinterpreted if shared with an overly-wide audience).
