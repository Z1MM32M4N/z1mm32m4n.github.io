## Projects

>
> Fred Brooks, _The Mythical Man-Month_

I keep all the things I spend my time working on [on GitHub].\
Here are my favorite kinds of things to work on:

- [Command line utilities][topic:cli]

  I mostly write command line tools in Bash and Haskell.

- [Tools for writing][topic:writing]

  I use Pandoc and Markdown for all my writing needs.

- [Vim plugins][topic:vim]

  I'm a big fan of Vim. These are the Vim plugins and resources I've made.

- [My dotfiles][topic:config]

  I spend a lot of time configuring my development environment.

- [Programming language theory][topic:plt]

  I've been fascinated by types and programming languages since school, and
  enjoy putting the ideas I've learned into practice.

## Writing

I keep my writings in two places:\

- [blog.jez.io] for technical posts
- [jez.io/thoughts/] for non-technical musings musings

Recently, I've been writing about types and about programming.\
Some selected articles:

- [Code Review from the Command Line]

  I do the bulk of my code review from the command line, especially when
  reviewing larger changes. This post explores why and how I do this.

- [Union Types in Flow & Reason]

  Union types are powerful yet often overlooked. This post explores some of the
  tradeoffs in the way Flow implements union types versus ReasonML.

- [Variables and Binding]

  Variables are central to programming languages, yet they’re often overlooked.
  This post walks through three approaches to implementing variables.

- [Social. Private. Open. Pick Three][on-leaving-facebook]

  I no longer use Facebook. This post outlines why I made this decision, and
  what I use for communicating with people instead.

## Talks

I mostly prefer writing, but from time to time I give talks.

## Work

> My heart is in the work.
>
> Andrew Carnegie

I'm currently very satisfied with my work, but am still interested to hear about
opportunities if you're:

1.  using Haskell, OCaml, or related languages,
2.  based in Pittsburgh, or
3.  developing programming language-related tools.

I've been lucky enough to work at a number of great companines:

- [Stripe] - [Ruby Type Checker]

  > Aug 2018 - ···

  I'm currently working on a static type checker for Ruby, including developing
  features and rolling it out to Stripe's codebase. Stripe has millons of lines
  of Ruby and hundreds of developers, so we see adding types to Ruby as a key
  way to improve developer productivity.

- [Stripe] - [Stripe Elements]

  > Aug 2017 - Aug 2018

  I spent a year doing frontend development on Stripe Elements, a JavaScript
  UI library for collecting payment information. We emphasized cross-platform
  compatibility, rigorous types and testing, and high product quality.

- [Stripe] - [Stripe Checkout]

  > May 2016 - Aug 2016

  When I interned at Stripe, I worked on improving the developer experience of
  Checkout. Checkout is often a developer's first experience with Stripe, so we
  wanted to make sure the onboarding experience was top notch.

- [Dropbox] - [Dropbox Paper]

  > May 2015 - Aug 2015

  When I interned at Dropbox, I worked on Paper. Paper is a collaborative
  workspace for teams. My specific project was to add rich embeds for things
  like YouTube videos and Google Docs.

- [Bloomberg]

  > May 2014 - Aug 2014

  When I interned at Bloomberg, I worked on an internal financial simulation
  tool in C++ that enabled developers to prototype and test their apps.

## Other interests

- I played on my high school's table tennis team. I still play table tennis in
  my free time.

- I watch way too much anime. Happy to give recommendations.

- I enjoyed being a teaching assistant. The courses I helped teach:

  - [15-131 Great Practical Ideas for CS][131]
  - [15-150 Functional Programming][150]
  - [15-210 Parallel and Sequential Data Structures and Algorithms][210]
  - [15-312 Principles of Programming Languages][312]

- I was an active member of [ScottyLabs], a student organization at CMU
  dedicated to improving the campus tech community. We hosted [TartanHacks] and
  put on various other events throughout the year.
