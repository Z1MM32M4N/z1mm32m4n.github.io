The best way to refer to me is as either **jez** or **Jake**. Using JEZ is
weird, but at least not incorrect. Please **don't** refer to me as Jez 🙏

My name is Jacob Eric Zimmerman. Only my mom calls me Jacob—everyone else calls
me **Jake**.

On the internet, I also go by my username: **jez**. People who met me first on
the internet also call me **jez** when referring to me in real life.

My username is just my initials, so it's technically correct to also refer to me
as JEZ or J. E. Z. No one does this.

My username is **not** Jez, nor is it my name. Recently, I learned that Jez is
actually a [nickname] for people named Jeremy. I am not Jeremy, nor am I Jez.

[nickname]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jez_(nickname)

Please refer to me as either **Jake** or **jez**. Of those two I have no strong
preference. Thanks!
