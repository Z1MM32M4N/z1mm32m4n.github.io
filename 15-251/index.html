          <p class="lead text-center">TAs in 15-251 really like to give us board game proofs. I myself find that it's useful to be able to play these games to get a feel for their dynamics. Here are a few that I've taken the time to whip up into web games!</p>
          <p>Also, if you wrote your own player, or if you added a feature to one of those already listed here, let me know! I'd be more than happy to include it.</p>
