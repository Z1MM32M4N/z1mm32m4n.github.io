I pick things up pretty quick too: everything you see here I've learned since I got to CMU less than 6 months ago. I always love trying out new techniques and taking risks.</p></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="row no-margin"><div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"><h6 class="text-center">Jacob Zimmerman<span class="reset"> - </span><a href="/Resume.pdf" class="brand-success">Resume</a><span class="reset"> - </span><a href="mailto:jake@zimmerman.io" class="brand-success">Email</a><span class="reset"> - </span><a href="https://github.com/Z1MM32M4N" class="brand-success">GitHub</a><span class="reset"> - </span>(c) 2014</h6></div></div></div><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/public/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/public/js/main.js"></script></body></html>
