<h1>No DMs, please</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>See also: <a href="/jez/">jez not Jez</a></p>

<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Please avoid sending me direct messages (DMs) to ask me questions.
(Especially technical questions.)</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>If you can ask me a question in a public space, please ask it
there.<br />
If you can‚Äôt or aren‚Äôt sure whether you can ask it in public, feel free
to DM me (but know that my first response might be to request that you
re-ask it in a public space).</p>
<p>Some suggestions for public spaces to ask questions in include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>#discuss</code> channel on the <a
href="https://sorbet.org/slack">Sorbet Slack</a> or the <a
href="https://twitter.com/sorbet_ruby">Sorbet Twitter</a> account (for
Sorbet-related questions),</li>
<li>GitHub Issues and GitHub Discussions where available</li>
<li>Public work channels (if you and I are co-workers)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>exception</strong>: if you have questions for me relating
to my employer, or are curious to know whether I‚Äôm open to new roles
elsewhere, please <strong>do</strong> email or DM me, as I do not prefer
answering these questions in public.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, <strong>do not</strong> let the first message be
merely ‚ÄúHello‚Äù or ‚Äúüëã‚Äù because that will ding me immediately, and then
I‚Äôll impatiently await the actual question while watching a ‚Äúuser is
typing‚Äù indicator.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>Questions are excellent moments to teach and share knowledge. When
asked in public spaces, a couple good things happen:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Other people get to <strong>see the question</strong>.</p>
<p>Sometimes other people learn more simply from seeing the questions
other people are asking. Seeing other peoples‚Äô questions helps them
expand their horizons into new territories.</p></li>
<li><p>Other people get to <strong>see the answer</strong>.</p>
<p>Chances are, you‚Äôre neither the first nor the last person to ask me
your question. By asking it in the open, it makes it easier for other
people to find answers to their questions in the future.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>My teammates</strong> get a chance to learn from my
answers.</p>
<p>Part of my job is to help those around me grow. One way I can do this
is by sharing my knowledge with them. When they get to see how I answer
questions, it helps share my knowledge with my teammates and equip them
to help answer similar questions in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>You <strong>get answers faster</strong> in expectation.</p>
<p>I check all notifications at the same speed. Whether you send me a DM
or mention me in a Slack channel, I‚Äôll respond to those notifications at
the same speed. For example, if I‚Äôm on vacation, I‚Äôll have <em>all</em>
notifications paused, and you may not hear back from me for days or
weeks. Asking the question in public increases your odds that someone
else who can answer your question sees it quickly.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h2>
<p>Of course, feel free to send me DMs for situations like these:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you have something personal or confidential to say. This
includes if you have individual feedback to give to me. (Thanks in
advance for your feedback.)</p></li>
<li><p>You‚Äôre not comfortable asking a question in a public space. (If
this is the case, please say so, otherwise my first response will likely
be to request that you re-ask your question in public.)</p></li>
<li><p>If you don‚Äôt know of a good public space to ask it. For example,
the <a href="https://sorbet.org/slack">Sorbet Slack</a> is a good place
to ask me Sorbet questions, but is not a good place to ask me questions
about other projects. In these cases feel free to contact me directly
(but know that if there is a good public forum to ask the question, I
may redirect you there first before answering).</p></li>
<li><p>To share jokes or memes üòâ (especially those that you think might
be misinterpreted if shared with an overly-wide audience).</p></li>
</ul>
