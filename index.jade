          p 
            | This is my favorite work-in-progress app. Targeting the technical CS/Math student, it allows people to efficiently combine the quickness and ease of Markdown note-taking with LaTeX for typesetting. It also features auto compilation, vim/emacs keybindings, cloud backup, and many other cool features that combine to make one awesome note-taking app.

          p.lead With gitorial, making tutorials is as easy as commiting a repository to GitHub.
          p The product of TartanHacks 2014, this app won $750 worth of AWS credit and nearly placed overall. It reduces the process of creating a programming/code tutorial to three simple steps: make a GitHub repository where each commit is a step of a tutorial, sign in to gitorial to add some explanation text to each slide, and finally view your live tutorial.
          p This project never could have happened without the help of Aaron Gutierrez, 
            a(href="http://www.shyamr.info/") Shyam Raghavan
            | , and 
            a(href="http://westinlohne.com/") Westin Lohne
            | . In the future, we have tons of amazing features planned, the most prominent of which being using git diffs to show changes between steps, so people can more easily follow the sometimes subtle changes between steps of a tutorial.

          p.lead June 2013 - August 2013
          p This summer I worked at my school's tech department. It was a great experience, because I got to see what it's like working on projects with co-workers to make sure the school's technology ran smoothly throughout various summer activities. 
          p Among the technologies I dealt with were BIOS level maintenance, imaging computers, and troubleshooting staff computer issues. I had a great time and was able to pick up quite a few tricks to make computers behave how they're supposed to.

          p One of my most transformative work experiences was the business I ran every summer cutting grass in my neighborhood. Not only did I get to meet and interact with tons of great customers, I used the opportunity to perfect a Java app that tracked my expenses throughout the summers. Writing and rewriting the app every summer let me get into some nitty-gritty details of the Java language.

          p.lead October 2011 - August 2013
          p Working for almost two years as a math and reading tutor at Kumon was definitely one of the most fun jobs I ever had. I got work one-on-one with students ranging from high-school to pre-K on every level of comprehension in between. It's from this job that I learned how best to explain topics and communicate new concepts in different ways to different people.

        h4 About me
        p.light My name is Jacob Zimmerman, I'm 19 years old, and I love calling New Berlin, Wisconsin home. I currently attend Carnegie Mellon University studing Computer Science as a part of the class of 2017 (with hopes of graduating sooner!).
        p.light I spend my free time (wait... that doesn't sound right) making cool things and trying to help other people make cooler things. I'm pretty good with a yo-yo, and I love playing ping-pong and tennis (when it's not snowing outside).
        p.light I prefer wielding Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Node.js, but I've also worked in C, C++, Python, and a few others. I pick things up pretty quickly too: everything you see here I've learned since I got to CMU less than 6 months ago. I always love trying out new techniques and taking risks.
